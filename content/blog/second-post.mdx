Use file-based routes in `src/routes` to grow the app.

Keep shared UI in `src/components` and tune visual tokens in `src/styles.css`.

## Route design tips

Treat routes like product domains, not technical buckets.

- `routes/settings.*` for account surfaces
- `routes/billing.*` for payment and plan logic
- `routes/api.*` for server handlers that belong to the same domain

When route trees map to business intent, onboarding gets faster and refactors
hurt less.

```tsx
// src/routes/billing.index.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute('/billing/')({
  component: BillingPage,
})
```

<MdxMetrics
  items={[
    { label: 'Route setup', value: '~10 min' },
    { label: 'Type safety', value: 'end-to-end' },
    { label: 'Refactor risk', value: 'lowered' },
  ]}
/>

### Collaboration pattern

Use this lightweight ownership split:

1. Product owns route naming and URL intent
2. Design owns shared layout primitives and tokens
3. Engineering owns loaders, actions, and caching

This pattern keeps URL design, data loading, and UI composition in one place.

Semantic tokens keep your UI stable while the brand evolves.

Instead of hard-coding one-off colors in components, shape a small set of
variables and map all surfaces to those variables.

## Why this matters

- You can restyle the app in minutes instead of days
- Light and dark themes stay behaviorally consistent
- Add-on pages inherit your visual identity by default

<MdxCallout title="MDX Component Demo">
  This callout is rendered from JSX inside an MDX post. It is useful for
  release notes, warnings, and migration tips where you want stronger visual
  emphasis than plain markdown blocks.
</MdxCallout>

<MdxMetrics
  items={[
    { label: 'Token count', value: '12 core vars' },
    { label: 'Theme modes', value: 'light + dark + auto' },
    { label: 'Restyle time', value: '< 30 min' },
  ]}
/>

### Token-to-component mapping

| Token | Typical usage |
| --- | --- |
| `--surface` | Card backgrounds |
| `--line` | Borders and separators |
| `--lagoon-deep` | Links and active nav |

Keep the mapping documented and your team will make fewer ad-hoc styling calls.

### Example: deriving UI from semantic tokens

```tsx
const button = {
  color: 'var(--sea-ink)',
  background: 'var(--surface)',
  borderColor: 'var(--line)',
}
```

MDX is useful here because you can interleave narrative, tables, code blocks,
and custom JSX components in one authoring surface.
